The Rogue is an adaptable, agile warrior who can specialize in ranged or close quarters combat.
She can best any foe with her imbued weapons, perform powerful combo attacks, and can augment her arsenal
with deadly poisons and sheadow magic to slay demons with impunity.

Heroic adventurers can clear out Strongholds such as this one, claiming them once again for the citizens of Sanctuary.
The town will never be the same, but victory here can leave a lasting mark and transform this hostile region into a safe haven.
